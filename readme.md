# Alutiiq

A simple command-line based cardgame.

It's heavily inspired by Dominion.


## Requirements

1. Python 3+ (Tested on 3.8.6 only)
2. The `curses` python module (pre-installed on linux)
  - On Windows: run `python -m pip install windows-curses`

Note that the game does not run well on Windows yet.


## Running the game

1. Clone this repository.
2. run `python game.py` or `python3 game.py` to start playing.

## How to play

Alutiiq is a deckbuilder, meaning that you try and create strategies around existing cards.

If you've played Dominion before, you will most likely be familiar with the mechanics already. If not, I suggest you take a look at the [rules](./docs/rules.md)
