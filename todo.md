- [X] Feature: Information option in turn
- [ ] Enhancement - actions: Allow player to pick a number rather than having to type the full action card
- [ ] Refactor: Figure out a way to shorten data.xyz to just become part of the data package
    Example: to import the player object, you'd need to write `from data.player import Player`
    End result: `from data import Player`
